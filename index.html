                <h2>Ocean Temperatures Have Reached a Record-Breaking High</h2>
                <span id="qw">What does it mean?</span>
                <p>
                    Our planet's oceans are warmer than they've ever been in recorded human history. And ocean
                    temperatures are not only increasing, they are heating up at an accelerating rate, according to a
                    new analysis. "The amount of heat we have put in the world's oceans in the past 25 years equals to
                    3.6 billion Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions," lead author Lijing Cheng, associate professor with the
                    International Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics
                    (IAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said in the statement. "There are no reasonable
                    alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat-trapping gases to explain this heating."

                    To analyze temperature changes in the oceans, Cheng and the team used all of the available data —
                    measured from a number of different devices, including 3,800 drifting so-called Argo floats
                    scattered across the oceans — published by the World Ocean Database and the National Oceanic and
                    Atmospheric Administration. All of the measurements were taken between the surface of the water and
                    a depth of 6,562 feet (2,000 meters).</p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, the ocean temperature was about 0.135 degrees Fahrenheit (0.075 degrees Celsius) higher
                    than the average between 1981 and 2010, an international group of researchers reported on Jan. 13 in
                    the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.</p>
                <h1>Something else</h1>
                <p>"The amount of heat we have put in the world's oceans in the past 25 years equals to 3.6 billion
                    Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions," lead author Lijing Cheng, associate professor with the
                    International Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics
                    (IAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said in the statement. "There are no reasonable
                    alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat-trapping gases to explain this heating."</p>
                <p>
                    They compared data taken between 1987 and 2019 with that taken from 1955 to 1986 and found that the
                    oceans warmed 450% more in the more recent time stint than in the earlier bracket, according to the
                    statement. The ocean has been the warmest in the past 10 years than it's been since measurements
                    were first taken in the 1950s.

                    The oceans can be a good measure of the effect of climate change since they absorb the majority of
                    excess heat from the atmosphere, the researchers wrote. The effects of the warming are already
                    appearing as more extreme weather, rising sea levels and harm to ocean animals, according to the
                    statement.

                    Though humans can work to reverse the effects of climate change, the oceans — which absorbed more
                    than 90% of the excess heat — will take longer to bounce back than the land and atmosphere, which
                    only absorbed 4%, according to the statement.

                <h1>So in conclusion ...</h1>
                <p> "Global warming is real, and it's getting worse," co-author John Abraham,
                    professor of thermal sciences at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, said in the statement.
                    "And this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is to come." </p>
